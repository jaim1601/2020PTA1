All the code requirements have been met. 
The program has not been seen to crash or behave abnormally and runs as required


The code however could be improved by using for/while loops. 
With a loop, the random number generator can create 24 random numbers within one loop rather than
creating them all seperatley.
An array could also provide to be useful as it could store all the randomly generated numbers rather
than having to store them all on seperate variables and having to compare all these variables
with the user's guesses.
If an array could be used, the user's guesses would only have to be compared to one array rather 
than 8 different variables.
